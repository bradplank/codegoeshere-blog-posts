Promise Libraries
=================

After considering several ways to improve the readability of a few REST service endpoints, a promise library appears to be one of the most 'promising' solutions.  (Yes, I cringed as well...but my backspace key refuses to delete that line.)  Here is the list of promise libraries I plan to compare features and performance over the next week or two.

* [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) - Bluebird is widely reputed to be the fastest (or at least most highly-optimized) of the promises libraries that work with Node.

* [RSVP](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js) - RSVP is a tiny Promises/A+ implementation that does very little beyond the basics in the spec, and is thus a good way to get your head wrapped around the ideas.

* [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) - If you want something that behaves as close to the draft ES6 promise spec as possible, there's ES6-Promises, which is a modified version of RSVP with the draft ES6 API.

* [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) - Venerable, but it is also pretty complex and thus maybe not the best place to start.

Comparison in process...
